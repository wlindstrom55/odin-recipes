# TOP Foundation HTML project - A basic recipe website.

	- The point of this project is to have one main index.html that links to other recipes, in the form of more html files.
		- It will look mostly very basic and is meant for practicing html usage and structure
		- I hope to at least make it look fun. And I'm trying to use the cmd prompt for creating all the files and using all the files. 
		- and also to practice git.
